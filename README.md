# HW-React-Scraper
UCLA Homework Week 19

This is my first react project, and it is composed of 3 components search, results, and saved articles.  A user can search New York Times for articles related to a specific topic during a specific time period.  The results are limited to 10 articles and eventually I will add the ability to save an article to mongodb.  This has been the hardest homework yet, and I can't wait to get it fully working.
